# online-payment-fraud-detection

The Online Payment Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based project designed to detect fraudulent transactions in real time. Using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the system analyzes transaction data to identify suspicious patterns.

The project applies machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent. Key features include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using metrics like ROC-AUC score.

By detecting fraudulent activities early, this system helps financial institutions and e-commerce platforms minimize financial losses, enhance security, and build customer trust.
